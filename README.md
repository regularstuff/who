## How To Play

Clone this repo, and use python to run main.py.  You don't need to install any 
third party libraries for the "main" branch.  (other branches have code specifically
to illustrate use of other libraries)

```shell
python3 main.py
```

## Installing your own questions

3 Options:

1. Replace the file `demo_questions.txt` with yours.
2. Extend the file `demo_questions.txt` with your questions.
3. Replace the file path in `main.py` with one of your files.

For how the file structure works, see `demo_questions.txt`.
